This repository contains an implementation to the Neurips 2019 paper Controlling Neural Level Sets.

This paper presents a simple and scalable approach to directly control level sets of a deep neural network. Our method consists of two parts: (i) sampling of the neural level sets, and (ii) relating the samples' positions to the network parameters. The latter is achieved by a \emph{sample network} that is constructed by adding a single fixed linear layer to the original network. In turn, the sample network can be used to incorporate the level set samples into a loss function of interest.Â
